# Desktop Operating System Case Project  
### Case Project: Implementing Windows 11 on VMware with Enterprise Configuration Tasks  

## Overview  
This is a **hands-on case project** completed as part of the **Desktop Operating Systems** course at **George Brown College**. The project involved setting up a Windows 11 virtual machine in VMware Workstation and performing a series of system administration tasks to simulate a real-world enterprise IT environment.

## Objective  
The goal of this project was to develop foundational skills in configuring, managing, and securing a Windows 11 operating system in a virtualized environment. Tasks included VM setup, user provisioning, local policy enforcement, storage configuration, PowerShell scripting, and security settings.

## Scenario  
As a system administrator, I was assigned to prepare and configure a Windows 11 environment for an internal company workstation. Using VMware Workstation, I installed and customized the operating system to meet the organizationâ€™s IT policies, security standards, and user access requirements.

## Tasks Covered
